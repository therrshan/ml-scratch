## Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression  
- Neural Network
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis

## Features

- No external ML libraries (scikit-learn used only for metrics/preprocessing)
- Complete mathematical implementations
- Built-in visualization tools
- Comprehensive documentation
- Real dataset applications

## Usage

1. Navigate to `notebooks/[dataset]/`
2. Run data cleaning notebook
3. Apply algorithms in ML notebook
4. Analyze results

Each algorithm script is standalone and can be imported directly.

## Purpose

Educational resource demonstrating ML algorithm internals with practical applications on real datasets.
